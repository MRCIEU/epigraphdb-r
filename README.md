EpiGraphDB is an analytical platform and database to support data mining in epidemiology. The platform incorporates a graph of causal estimates generated by systematically applying Mendelian randomization to a wide array of phenotypes, and augments this with a wealth of additional data from other bioinformatic sources.

This is the R package to provide R users with more ease of use for querying with EpiGraphDB.
