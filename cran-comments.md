## Resubmission (2020-08-07)

In this resubmission I have made the following changes:

- Updated DESCRIPTION to conform with CRAN policies (checked with a local rhub environment `rhub::local_check_linux()`).
- Updated the URL link of a CRAN package.
- Fixed a few other minor issues identified by rhub's local check `rhub::local_check_linux()`.
