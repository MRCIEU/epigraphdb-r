# epigraphdb 0.2.3

Fixed the issue of the package size too large.

(2022-01-14 first submissioin)
This is a minor update making the package building and checks more resilient to issues of internet resources.

- When a function call to web service resources fails, either because of the user or the service, it is now easier to trace the issue with more context provided.
- Vignettes are now pre-computed. Some vignettes involving lengthy analysis steps are moved to EpiGraphDB's documentation.
- When running package checks on cran, code examples of functions that rely on internet resources are put in `\dontrun{}`, and the same applies for unit tests (`skip_on_cran` in `testthat`).
  - Function code examples get run and checked when the pkgdown static site are built by GitHub Actions.
  - Tests (including ones relying on internet resources) get regularly run by GitHub Actions.
